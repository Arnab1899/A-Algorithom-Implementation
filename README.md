# A-Algorithom-Implementation

It is an informed search algorithm. Informed search algorithm contains an array of knowledge such as how far a node is from the goal, path cost, how to reach the goal node etc. A* search algorithm combines both UCS and greedy best first search algorithms.

It was my Artificial Intelligence and Expert System Lab project. The assigned problem is implementation of a small address map from my home to UAP, using A* search algorithm and find out the optimal path.
